### Here are some tips for making Tuo Zaafi:

Use fresh, cold water to make the dough. This will help to prevent the dough from becoming sticky.
Knead the dough well until it is smooth and elastic. This will help to ensure that the Tuo Zaafi is cooked evenly.
Do not overcook the Tuo Zaafi. It should be cooked through, but still soft and fluffy.
Serve Tuo Zaafi hot with your favorite stew or soup. This will help to bring out the flavors of the dish.
